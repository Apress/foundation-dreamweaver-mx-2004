This folder contains two versions each of the main files used in Chapter 12:

order.html
confirmation.php

The files named as above are the versions created at the beginning of the chapter. They are exactly the same as the final versions in Chapter 11, but have been included here for the benefit of readers needing to work with fresh versions. By the end of the chapter, they should resemble:

order_final.html
confirmation_final.php

Most of the remaining files demonstrate issues raised during the chapter. The only exception is PHPcurrency_snip1.0.mxp. This will install three snippets into the PHP folder of the Snippets Panel (and will create the folder if it doesn't already exist). The snippets can be used to format currencies as dollars, pounds or euros. If you do not know how to install mxp files, please see the Appendix to "Foundation Dreamweaver MX 2004".
